    binary tree
        a tree with a maximum of two children for each node

    children
        the nodes that one node leads to

    edge
        connects two nodes in a tree; has only one incoming edge

    height
        the maximum level of any node in the tree

    inorder
        recursive tree traversal in which the left subtree is visited, then the
        root node, followed by the right subtree
    leaf node
        a node that has no children

    level
        the number of edges on the path from the root to the current node

    node
        part of the tree that holds information

    parent
        a node that leads to other nodes

    path
        an ordered list of nodes connected by edges

    postorder
        recursive tree traversal in which the left subtree is visited, then the
        right, followed by the root node

    preorder
        recursive tree traversal in which the root node is visited, then the
        left, followed by the right subtree

    root
        the starting point of the tree; has no incoming edges

    sibling
        children of the same parent node

    tree
        a hierarchal data structure with a root, branches, and leaves.

    subtree
        a section of a tree
