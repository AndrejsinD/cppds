What Are Linked Structures?
---------------------------

A linked data structure is a data structure which consists of a
set of data structures called nodes which are linked together and organized
by links created via references or pointers.

Linked data structures include linear linked structures like linked lists
as well as a variety of different types of tree data structures.
In this chapter we will consider linear linked structures, both ordered and unordered.
